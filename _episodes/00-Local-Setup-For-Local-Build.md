## Instructions for local setup to build your lessons - very useful


> ## Carpentries instructions 
> The Carpentries provide excellent instructions and examples at: [https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html).  
> Carpentries has moved on to an 'R' based system which we are not using. We are still using this older format.

## Do local setup for local rendering (optional)

Follow the instructions [https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html#setup-for-local-rendering-of-the-lessons-optional](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html#setup-for-local-rendering-of-the-lessons-optional) for setup on your local machine - in principle this is optional but in practice it is really helpful.  You are going to need ruby and pyYAML.  I used conda on a mac but they have instructions for Windows, Mac and UNIX. 

> ## Alert 
> At this point you should stop following their instructions and start using our github template to avoid overwriting DUNE specific items.
